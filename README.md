## Medico Bot
##### Medico Bot is your conversational bot-based one stop mental and physical diagnosis solution along with severity detection based on symptoms. It also detects and shows nearest medical facility on map.

### Problem and Solution:
Disease Detection is a very important use-case in the Healthcare Industry. There is no existing personalized **conversational platform** which detects diseases based on **patient's physical symptoms** and redirects to the nearest hospital based on the user's location.

Apart from this, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted or halted critical mental health services in **93%** of countries worldwide while the demand for **mental health** is increasing, according to a new WHO survey. Thus, Mental Health is also an alarming topic and we want people to talk about it with any hesitation.
We have designed a Chatbot, which will interact with the patients and diagnose the potential disease from which a person can be suffering and also the detects **severity** level of that disease (eg. Home Care, See a Doctor, or Ambulance).

In the same chatbot one can take a Mental Health Test. The Mental Health Test is built with high standards. It implements the study of **PHQ-SADS**, **PHQ-15** & **GAD-7**. It helps in diagnosis of Stress, Anxiety, Depression and also looks out for Somatic Symptom Disorder.

Our Solution will also be providing medical assistance like recommending the nearest Hospital based on the **real-time location** of user detected by GPS using Google Geolocation API and shows it on map using MapmyIndia API. The chatbot will engage users in conversation.

### Usage:
- For **Physical Health** Checkup, continue by describing primary symptoms like fever, back pain etc.
- For **Mental Health** Checkup, type "begin MentalHealthBot" to get started with PHQ-SADS test.
